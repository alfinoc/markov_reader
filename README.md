The application generates nonsensical word sequences from a collection of indexed source texts by alternating between sequential reading and probabilistic jumping. Splicing the two source sentences:

<i>I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.</i>

<i>He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without a chimney or globe of any kind.</i>

Might result in the generated text:

<i>I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without a chimney or globe of any kind.</i>
